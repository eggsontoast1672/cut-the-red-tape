# Cut The Red Tape!

## Overview

A game of tape-throwing and rule-breaking.

I originally started to make this game for the [Mini Jame Gam #16][1], but plans
changed and I ended up making a different game. The idea for this project was so
good, though, that I just couldn't leave it behind.

It's some sort of a competition involving duct tape, but you have to cheat to
win when nobody is looking.

- Duct-tape-roll-throwing competition
- The one who can throw the roll of duct tape the furthest wins
- You have to unravel it while nobody is looking

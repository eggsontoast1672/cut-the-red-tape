# Cut The Red Tape!

## Description

A game of tape-throwing and rule-breaking.

I'll add more here later.

Cut the Red Tape

It's some sort of a competition involving duct tape, but you have to cheat to
win when nobody is looking.

- Duct-tape-roll-throwing competition
- The one who can throw the roll of duct tape the furthest wins
- You have to unravel it while nobody is looking
